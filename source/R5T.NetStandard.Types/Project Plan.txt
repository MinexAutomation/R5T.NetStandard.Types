R5T.NetStandard.Types - A base types library containing types that only depend on base .NET Standard functionality.

Goals

Design

IDescriber - Allows encapsulating the behavior of describing an object.
IDescriber<T> - Allows specifying the type that can be described. The generic interface does not inherit from the non-generic interface to allow implementers the option of not implementing the non-generic Describe(object) (which requires a type-check on the input object instance to ensure it has the specified generic type).
ToStringDescriber - A simple describer that just calls the object.ToString() method.

IStringSerializer<T> - Allows serialization to/from a string type.

IDescriber vs. IStringSerializer - Description implies uni-directional object to string only, while serialization implies bi-directional object to string and string to object. Description also implies a lossy serialization (not all object information is serialized). Serialization by definition means capturing all object information.
